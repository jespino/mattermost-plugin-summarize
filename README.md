# Mattermost LLM Extensions Plugin

The LLM extensions plugin adds functionality around the use and development of LLMs like GPT-3.5 / 4 and hugging face models within Mattermost. 

Currently at the experimental phase of development. Contributions and suggestions welcome!

## React for me
Just for fun! Use the post menu to ask the bot to react to the post. It will try to pick an appropriate reaction.

## RLHF Feedback Collection
Bot posts will have :+1: :-1: icons for collecting feedback. The idea would be to use this as input for RLHF fine tuning.


## Installation

1. Go the releases page and download the latest release.
2. On your Mattermost, go to System Console -> Plugin Management and upload it. [More Details](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/plugins.html#plugin-uploads)
3. Enable the plugin and configure plugin settings as desired.

## Configuration

Lots of unfinished work in the system console settings. For now all you need to do is input and OpenAI API Key and configure allowed teams/users as desired. More options and the ability to use local LLMs is on the roadmap.
